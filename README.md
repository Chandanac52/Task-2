Objective:
Implement a sentiment classifier using a deep learning model trained on labeled text reviews.

Key Features:

Dataset: Labeled file reviews.txt (binary sentiment: positive/negative).

Preprocessing using CountVectorizer.

Model: Feedforward neural network with ReLU and CrossEntropyLoss.

Visualizes training loss using matplotlib.

Final model saved as .pth file.

Technologies:
PyTorch, sklearn, matplotlib

Deliverables:

 reviews.txt (input data)
